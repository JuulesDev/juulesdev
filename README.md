  <h2>Hello there ! ðŸ‘‹</h2>

### ./i'm-Jules
I'm currently in my first year of prÃ©pa in MP2I (maths, physics & IT), trying to get better at what I learnt alone on my computer.

### ./my-hobbies
I _love_ programming, obviously, but I also love everything that is nerdy enough. Space, everything that flies, playing chess, video games, ...

### ./my-goals
I am trying to always write better code, and I am learning using lower level programming languages.
